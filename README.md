## Synopsis ##

*eGorilla* is a Peer-to-Peer application developed entiredly in *Java* under *GPLv2 General Public License* as final project for the _"Software Engineering"_ course at _Faculty of Computer Science_ of _Complutense Unversity of Madrid_ during 2008/2009 academic course in the group 4B.

The application is intended to work under the Complutense University of Madrid labs exclusively although the intial scope included a more ambitious and greater scope.

eGorilla is compounded of three key elements:
- *Client:* the eGorilla client in which users can search files and monitor the status of their dowloads in various tabs 
- *Server:* the server part of the application that dispatches the various requests that can receive from all the clients connect to it
- *Communication (Protocol):* implmentation of our own network protocol for data transmission between the servers and the clients

## Motivation ##
The project aims at put into practice all the concepts studied within the _"Software Engineering"_ course into a real project as well as other areas of expertise as network.

The project itself represented indeed a perfect simulation of what eventually a real work scenario would feel like for us, meaning that a lot of different people with different profiles working together over the same problem and submitting and integrating their changes on the same repository. As a matter of fact, for some of the team members it was their first experience with a *Control Version System* software.

## Installation Notes ##
System Requirements:

- Installation of *Java JRE 1.5* or later versions.
- Installation of *PDF Reader* software to visualize the documentation files.
